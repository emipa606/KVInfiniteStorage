Safe for existing saves. For those using Body Part and/or Textile Storage see the instructions below for how to do it.

Infinite Storage requires energy to compress and make available the stored items. The amount of energy required increases linearly as the weight stored increases. If Infinite Storage is not powered, nothing can be added or removed from it. For that reason it may not be a bad idea to keep some extra components, steel, and wood in an out-of-the-way stockpile.

I have decided that Infinite Storage will not break down - in case all components are stored within as that would suck.

There are two 'specialty' storage units: Body Parts and Textiles. These units are capable of storing Body Parts and Medicine and Leather/Wool without energy.
